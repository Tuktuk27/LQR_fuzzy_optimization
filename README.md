# LQR_fuzzy_optimization

The goal is to optimize the tunable LQR parameters and the design of the fuzzy logic controller through PSO or Reinforcement Learning. 

Those are controllers used on a car suspension simulation at first. 

Fuzzy logic controller is still to be worked on for more flexibility. It should be easily tunable by a RL model or by a PSO algorithm.

Reinforcement Learning has been done for a car-pole example but need to be reviewed and adjusted for this car suspension case.
