# LQR_fuzzy_optimization


## Introduction 

The goal is to optimize the tunable LQR parameters and the design of the fuzzy logic controller through PSO or Reinforcement Learning. 

Those are controllers used on a car suspension simulation at first. 

Fuzzy logic controller is still to be worked on for more flexibility. It should be easily tunable by a RL model or by a PSO algorithm.

Reinforcement Learning has been done for a car-pole example but need to be reviewed and adjusted for this car suspension case.


## Results

So far the LQR parameters could been optimized throughout a PSO algorithm. The fuzzy logic controller could also be improved, but its flexibility is to be improved so it could be applied to more complex systems.

Plotting results are to be done.
